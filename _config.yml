  <p>As a seasoned Software Consultant, I excel at diagnosing intricate system 
  infrastructure issues in both on-premises and AWS cloud environments. My 
  proficiency shines particularly in 'lift and shift' migrations, and I take pride 
  in modernizing architectures using cloud-native patterns such as the strangler 
  pattern.</p>

  <p>My expertise runs deep in mentoring teams, driving rapid application 
  engineering, and formulating frameworks that curtail development time and costs. 
  My consistent focus has always been on delivering exceptional value to clients, 
  optimizing software designs for both business and private users.</p>

  <p>Among my key competencies, I am a hands-on programmer with guru-level 
  expertise in GoLang, Java, and JavaScript. My full-stack development prowess is 
  demonstrated using Vue3.js for SPAs and Nuxt.js for SSR. With a solid background 
  in Data Migration & Microservices Architecture, I have also championed cloud 
  solutions, mastering the 'Lift & Shift' from on-premises to AWS and excelling in 
  modernizing with cloud-native techniques. My familiarity with the AWS Suite is 
  comprehensive, encompassing tools such as Lambda, SQS, and DynamoDB, among 
  others. In the realm of DevOps & CI/CD, I am proficient with Jenkins, Docker, 
  OpenShift, and the AWS toolset, in addition to Azure DevOps with Boards on 
  Microsoft Azure cloud. My skill set also covers Security Solutions with a deep 
  understanding of Identity Management. Infrastructure as Code is another forte, 
  where I wield tools like Terraform, AWS SAM, and Ansible. Additionally, I have 
  substantial experience with monitoring and management tools, particularly AWS 
  CloudWatch and Jira.</p>

  <p>If you seek a dedicated partner to elevate your software solutions and infrastructure, 
  I would be honored to discuss how my expertise can benefit your endeavors.</p>
