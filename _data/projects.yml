    Mr. Khalid, as the founder and primary developer, utilized his
    proficiency in GoLang and ReactJS to architect and develop a
    comprehensive wedding planning platform for his daughter's wedding.
    The front-end was meticulously crafted using ReactJS 16+, employing
    ReactJS Hooks and ReactJS Context for efficient state management,
    ensuring a highly interactive and responsive user interface. The
    platform incorporates an array of features: a visually appealing
    Picture Gallery, a streamlined Invitation Management system, a
    comprehensive Vendor Management interface, an intuitive Event
    Management module, and a dynamic Budget Management tool. In the
    backend, Mr. Khalid effectively harnessed Chi Router for efficient
    request routing, Postgres DB for robust data management, and Caddy as
    a reliable reverse proxy. The entire application was deployed on AWS
    EC2, assuring a reliable, swift, and seamless user experience.

    Mr. Khalid embarked on creating MetisMeshâ€”a self-built orchestration
    system, similar in function to Kubernetes but unique in its choice
    of technologies. This project not only enhanced his understanding of
    orchestration at a deep level, but also showcased his proficiency in
    Go, a language he chose for its simplicity and efficiency. In the
    realm of API management, MetisMesh leverages the Chi library, chosen
    for its lightweight and idiomatic approach to building Go HTTP
    services. For handling containers, he employed the Docker SDK,
    reaffirming his expertise in Docker and its operations. The system
    utilizes BoltDB for database management a simplistic yet performant
    key-value store, and goprocinfo library for the efficient collection
    of worker metrics. These choices underscore his ability to select
    and implement the right tools that best align with a project's
    specific requirements. With MetisMesh, Mr. Khalid has manifested his
    theoretical understanding of Kubernetes into a practical, tangible
    system, further solidifying his stature as a seasoned software
    developer with a deep grasp of orchestration systems.
