    Utilizing my skills in GoLang and ReactJS, I architected and 
    developed a comprehensive wedding planning website. The front-end 
    was precisely engineered using ReactJS 16+, employing ReactJS Hooks 
    and ReactJS Context for efficient state management, ensuring a 
    highly interactive and responsive user interface.
    
    The platform incorporates an array of features: a visually appealing 
    Picture Gallery, a streamlined Invitation Management system, a 
    comprehensive Vendor Management interface, an intuitive Event 
    Management module, and a dynamic Budget Management tool.
    
    In the backend, I effectively harnessed Chi Router for efficient 
    request routing, Postgres DB for robust data management, and Caddy 
    as a reliable reverse proxy. The entire application was deployed 
    on AWS EC2, assuring a reliable, swift, and seamless user experience.
