    Utilizing my skills in <strong>GoLang</strong> and <strong>ReactJS</strong>, I architected and 
    developed a comprehensive wedding planning website. The front-end 
    was precisely engineered using <strong>ReactJS 16+</strong>, employing <strong>ReactJS Hooks</strong> 
    and <strong>ReactJS Context</strong> for efficient state management, ensuring a 
    highly interactive and responsive user interface.
    
    The platform incorporates an array of features: a visually appealing 
    Picture Gallery, a streamlined Invitation Management system, a 
    comprehensive Vendor Management interface, an intuitive Event 
    Management module, and a dynamic Budget Management tool.
    
    In the backend, I effectively harnessed <strong>Chi Router</strong> for efficient 
    request routing, <strong>Postgres DB</strong> for robust data management, and <strong>Caddy</strong> 
    as a reliable reverse proxy. The entire application was deployed 
    on <strong>AWS EC2</strong>, assuring a reliable, swift, and seamless user experience.

    Mr. Khalid embarked on creating MetisMeshâ€”a self-built orchestration
    system, similar in function to <strong>Kubernetes</strong> but unique in its choice
    of technologies. This project not only enhanced his understanding of
    orchestration at a deep level, but also showcased his proficiency in
    <strong>Go</strong>, a language he chose for its simplicity and efficiency. In the
    realm of API management, MetisMesh leverages the <strong>Chi library</strong>, chosen
    for its lightweight and idiomatic approach to building Go HTTP
    services. For handling containers, he employed the <strong>Docker SDK</strong>,
    reaffirming his expertise in Docker and its operations. The system
    utilizes <strong>BoltDB</strong> for database management a simplistic yet performant
    key-value store, and <strong>goprocinfo</strong> library for the efficient collection
    of worker metrics. These choices underscore his ability to select
    and implement the right tools that best align with a project's
    specific requirements. With MetisMesh, Mr. Khalid has manifested his
    theoretical understanding of Kubernetes into a practical, tangible
    system, further solidifying his stature as a seasoned software
    developer with a deep grasp of orchestration systems.
